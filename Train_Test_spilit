# !pip install split-folders
# import splitfolders # or import splitfolders

# input_folder = r"F:/work/RSNA/Rough_work/experiment/Data_Copy"
# output = r"F:/work/RSNA/Rough_work/experiment/Data_out" #where you want the split datasets saved. one will be created if it does not exist or none is set

# splitfolders.ratio(input_folder, output=output, seed=42, ratio=(.8, .1, .1)) # ratio of split are in order of train/val/test. You can change to whatever you want. For train/val sets only, you could do .75, .25 for example.
